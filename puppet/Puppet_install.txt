===================== Puppet Pre-Installation =====================

Capacity Planning:

    2 CentOS 7 servers
    puppet-master   -	t2.medium
    puppet-client	-	t2.micro

edit /etc/hosts and add both these hosts and IP in the file

10.0.15.10      puppet-master
10.0.15.11      puppet-client

try to ping to the hosts

ping puppet-client
ping puppet-master

===================== NTP =====================

Install the NTP packages on both servers using the yum command.

yum -y install ntp ntpdate

choose the NTP pool 

ntpdate 0.centos.pool.ntp.org

start the NTP service and enable it

systemctl start ntpd
systemctl enable ntpd

===================== Disable SELinux =====================

/etc/sysconfig/selinux

SELINUX=disabled

===================== Add Puppet Repository =====================

rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppet5/puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm

When all these are completed reboot the instance.

 ===================== Install and Configure Puppetserver =====================

 Install puppet-server in puppet-master host

 yum -y install puppetserver

 configure the memory allocation for puppetserver. We will set the max memory allocation for puppetserver to 1GB.

 /etc/sysconfig/puppetserver

Change the line like below

 JAVA_ARGS="-Xms1g -Xmx1g ...."

edit the 'puppet.conf' file in the puppet configuration directory

/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

[master]
 dns_alt_names=puppet-master,puppet
 
 [main]
 certname = puppet-master
 server = puppet-master
 environment = production
 runinterval = 1h

start the puppetserver and enable it

systemctl start puppetserver
systemctl enable puppetserver

===================== Install and Configure Puppet Agent =====================

yum install -y puppet-agent

/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

[main]
 certname = puppet-client
 server = puppet-master
 environment = production
 runinterval = 1h

===================== Register the puppet agent to the puppet master =====================

Run the command below on the puppet agent shell.

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true

back to the puppet master shell and run the command below

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list

And you will get the pending Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from the puppet agent server 'puppet-client'.

Sign the certificate using the command below.

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign puppet-client

===================== Verify the Puppet Agent Configuration =====================

After the puppet master signed the certificate file for the agent, run command below on the puppet agent to verify the configuration.

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test

The Puppet agent will pull the configuration from the puppet master and applies to the server without any errorif everything is good.
